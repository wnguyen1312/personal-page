# About Me

Hello, I am a third-year  [MSci Physics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/physics-msci/)  student at Imperial College London. I am spending my junior year abroad at MIT, where I work at the [High Energy Density Physics Group](https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/research/hedp/index.html) under [Dr Maria Gatu Johnson] (https://www.psfc.mit.edu/people/scientific-staff/maria-gatu-johnson) to study energy modulation in directly driven inertial confinement fusion implosion. Previously, I worked under the guidance of [Dr Spencer Gessner] (https://profiles.stanford.edu/spencer-gessner) as part of the [beam-beam collaboration] (https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/8597/) to model QED effect of next-generation linear colliders. I was introduced to the basics of plasma physics and accelerators under [Professor Najmudinâ€™s] (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.najmudin) laser-plasma group. Finally, I worked under [Professor Khac-Thai Minh] (http://uphcm.edu.vn/emplinfo.aspx?EmplCode=thaikhacminh) to explore the potential of different molecules for drug developments through the molecular dynamics simulations.

I spent most of my life in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where I developed a deep appreciation for the vibrant culture and history that shapes daily life there. Outside of academics, I am passionate about traveling and exploring different cultures and cuisines, seeking to broaden my understanding and appreciation of the world.
