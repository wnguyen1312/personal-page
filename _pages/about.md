👨‍💻 I am a third-year  [MSci Physics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/physics-msci/)  student at Imperial College London 🇬🇧, spending my junior year abroad at MIT 🇺🇸 <br>

🔬 My research interests lie in accelerator physics and fusion science <br>

🛫 I grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 🇻🇳. I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures and cuisines! 


# Research

- During my year abroad at MIT, I work at the [High Energy Density Physics Group](https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/research/hedp/index.html) under [Dr Maria Gatu Johnson](https://www.psfc.mit.edu/people/scientific-staff/maria-gatu-johnson) to study energy modulation in directly driven inertial confinement fusion implosion. 
  
- Previously, I worked under the guidance of [Dr Spencer Gessner](https://profiles.stanford.edu/spencer-gessner) as part of the [beam-beam collaboration](https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/8597/) to model QED effect of next-generation linear colliders
    
- While in Vietnam and remotely, I have worked under [Professor Khac-Thai Minh](http://uphcm.edu.vn/emplinfo.aspx?EmplCode=thaikhacminh) to explore the potential of different molecules for drug development using molecular dynamics simulations.

- I was first introduced to the basics of plasma physics and accelerators while working in [Professor Zulfikar Najmudin’s](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/z.najmudin) laser-plasma group during my freshman summer.
