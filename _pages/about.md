# About Me

Hello, I am a third-year undergraduate in the [MSci Physics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/physics-msci/) course at Imperial College London. I am spending my junior year abroad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I conduct my MSci Thesis project at the [High Energy Density Physics Group](https://www-internal.psfc.mit.edu/research/hedp/index.html) at the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center. I previously worked at FACET-II at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, where I focused on modelling linear collider for electron and positron collision using GUINEA PIG and [WarpX PIC code](https://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX). Outside of academic work, I enjoy travelling and exploring the world of anime, delving into stories that span genres from epic adventures to slice-of-life comedies, allowing me to experience a vast array of cultures and ideas.


## Research 

My research has so far revolved around fusion and accelerator science. You can find more about my work on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=113hVE8AAAAJ&hl=en)
